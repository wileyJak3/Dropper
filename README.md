 ### Dropper (Asteroid)
- Dropper: Several asteroids fall from the top of the screen, and the user must avoid them. The player ship can be controlled with the arrow keys. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score. As the level increases the asteroids get faster, larger, and increase in quantity.
